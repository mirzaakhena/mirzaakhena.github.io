For very simple project, simple tools or just an simple service, you may try with simple layout instead.</p><p>When you first start your Go project you need to create a skeleton code and consistent structure. As your project grows keep in mind that it&#39;ll be important to make sure your code is well structured otherwise you&#39;ll end up with a messy code with lots of hidden dependencies and global state. When you have more people working on the project you&#39;ll need even more structure. That&#39;s when it&#39;s important to introduce a common way to manage.</p><p>Every project in every company has their own standard structure code layout. Every new joiners will always follow their &quot;ancestor&quot; developer. If you already have messy code structure in the first place, then your code will become more messy if not managed well.</p><h2 id="what-gogen-solve" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-gogen-solve" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What Gogen Solve</h2><p>Gogen is offering a better code structure for your project so you can maintain and increase productivity in every development phase.

Both of this approach require a guideline and mentor.</p><ul><li><p>Learning from the fundamental have no direction you don&#39;t have a motivation or knowledge where we should use or do something tobe an expert because you need to know the detail, learning from detail component, learning specific things, know the basic knowledge, not know the purpose, focus to the process, slow, learn from theoretically,</p></li><li><p>learning with specific goal you have a goal you have motivatation to achieve a goal to be a user because you don&#39;t understand the detail, learning from the template, learning general, not very understand the basic knowledge, know the purpose, focus to the goal, fast, learn from best practice,</p></li></ul><p>gogen apply the second way.

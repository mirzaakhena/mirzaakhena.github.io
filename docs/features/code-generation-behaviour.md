# Code Generation Behaviour

## Create new file
Create a file or folder is the basic things the gogen do

## Ignore the existing file
Whenever gogen want to create a file with some name, it will check if the file is already exist or not. If it already exist then gogen will ignore it because gogen don't want to ruin the existing code. (next feature gogen will inform which file skipped)  

## Code injection
### Manual injection
### Auto injection
Gogen will automatically inject some code in the Outport whenever user run `gogen repository` or `gogen service`
